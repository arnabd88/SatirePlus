An instruction sequnce is defined as:

    inst_seq : inst
             | inst "," inst_seq

    inst : "c" [0-9]+
         | "i" [0-9]+
         | "v" [0-9]+
         | "o" op
         | "f" func
         | "p" ("-"|"+")? [0-9]+

    op   : "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "p"

    func : "abs" | "cos" | "exp" | "log" | "neg" | "sin" | "tan" | "sqrt"

Instructions sequences are written in RPN. The behavior of each operation is
described below.

### Push onto stack:
* `c<num>` : Pushes a constant to the stack, `<num>` is an integer index into the
           constants array.
* `i<num>` : Pushes a variabe to the stack, `<num>` is an integer index into the
           variables array.

### Operators:
* `o<op>` : Applies the operator `<op>` to the top two elements of the stack.
    	  `<op>` is in the set defined above, where `p` is interval exponent power
	  function.

### Functions:
* `f<name>` : Applies single arg function `<name>` to the top element of the  stack
            and pushes the result.

### Integer power function:
* `p<num>` : Applies the power function to the top of the stack with integer
           exponent `<num>` and pushes the result.

When an instruction sequence is consumed the result of the calculation is the
sole element remaining on the stack.
